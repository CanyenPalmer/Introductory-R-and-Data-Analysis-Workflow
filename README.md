# Introductory R and Data Analysis Workflow

This project contains structured R code and narrative content from an interactive practice session. The focus is on foundational programming concepts in R, as well as practical data analysis strategies that support reproducible and efficient analytical workflows.

## Purpose

The document serves as a sandbox for reinforcing core analytical concepts in R. It introduces tools and patterns used frequently in applied data science, including data inspection, feature derivation, control flow, and summarization. It also emphasizes the use of RStudio and Quarto for iterative, literate analysis.

## Tools and Libraries

- **R**: Scripting language for statistical computing
- **Quarto**: Authoring format for creating dynamic documents and reports
- **Base R**: Core language constructs and base packages
- **Tidyverse (introduced)**: For future scaling with consistent syntax and tools

## Topics Covered

### Object Creation and Manipulation

- Creation of vectors using `c()`, sequences, and logical expressions
- Type checking with `typeof()`, `length()`, and coercion with `as.*` functions
- Subsetting using indexing and logical conditions

### Control Flow

- `if`, `else`, and `ifelse()` for conditional logic
- `for` loops for repeated execution over elements
- Discussion of when vectorization is preferred over iteration

### Custom Functions

- Writing and calling functions using `function()` syntax
- Parameter handling and return values
- Applying functions for modular and repeatable tasks

### Data Exploration and Summary

- Introduction to `data.frame` creation and structure
- Use of `summary()`, `str()`, and indexing to explore datasets
- Demonstration of data-driven computation using column-wise operations

### Applied Examples

- Coding exercises using numeric vectors, categorical flags, and boolean filters
- Implementation of mini workflows such as calculating means by group or applying conditionals across rows
- Focus on writing clean, readable, and testable R code

## Relevance to Analytics and Data Science

This document provides the scaffolding for more complex data analysis tasks such as:

- Feature engineering for modeling
- Development of analytical utilities or metric functions
- Structured exploratory analysis pipelines
- Debugging and testing reusable code logic

Mastery of these building blocks directly supports more advanced tooling in machine learning, time series analysis, and business intelligence pipelines.

## Getting Started

To run the file:

1. Open the `.qmd` file in RStudio.
2. Execute chunks individually to observe output and behavior.
3. Extend by wrapping logic into functions or adding conditional operations.

## Next Steps

While this practice session focused on foundational programming constructs, it sets the stage for more robust tasks such as:

- Data wrangling with `dplyr`
- Visualization with `ggplot2`
- Workflow automation and reporting with Quarto
